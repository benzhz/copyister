## Introduction
  
If you find long responses from large models overwhelming, and copying the content you need is time-consuming and cumbersome, I have developed this content extraction tool (Chrome extension) to help you easily extract key information.  
The operation is similar to highlighting important points in textbooks. You can mark content line by line, precisely identify the key information, and with one click, copy the selected content. This is perfect for quickly applying to document writing, report preparation, and other scenarios. The interface is simple and intuitive, with no complicated procedures, making it easy to use.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Download and Launch**: Download the tool from this repository, extract it, and install the Chrome extension.
2. **Paste Content**: Paste the full response given by the large model into the tool's input box.
3. **Mark and Copy**: Check the lines you consider important, and once you're done, click the "Copy" button to copy the selected content to your clipboard.

## Application Scenarios
  
• **Academic Research**: Quickly extract core points from the large model’s knowledge explanations for literature reviews.  
• **Work Reports**: Extract key data and conclusions from the industry analysis provided by the large model.  
• **Daily Learning**: Extract key points from the large model’s answers to assist with note-taking during learning.
